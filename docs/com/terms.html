            <h3>Orders, Payments, and Refunds</h3>
            <ul class="plist">
                <li>
                    Any prices listed publicly are estimates and I may adjust
                    them depending on the particular work requested.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I typically ask for half the price to be paid in advance,
                    and the other half on completion.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you cancel your order after I've started working on it,
                    you are not entitled to a refund of your advance payment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I may deny any commission request for any reason.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I may cancel and refund a commission in progress at any point.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Progress Guarantee</h3>
            <ul class="plist">
                <li>
                    If I make no meaningful progress on your unfinished commission 
                    for 8 weeks or more, and I am not awaiting a response from you,
                    you may consider me to have cancelled it, and are thus
                    entitled to a full refund.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Rights and Licensing</h3>
            <ul class="plist">
                <li>
                    I retain all rights to the finished work and any in-progress images.
                    Expect me to post the finished work on my social media.
                    If you'd like to remain anonymous, let me know in advance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You may use the finished work for non-commercial purposes. Unauthorized commercial use is prohibited.
