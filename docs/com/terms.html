    <h1>Milo's Commission Terms V1</h1>
    <p style="margin: 20px 60px 40px;">
    <em>** By commissioning my art, you agree to these terms.

        <h3>Orders, Payments, and Refunds</h3>
        <ul class="plist">
            <li>
                The prices listed on the commission sheet are estimates and I may adjust them depending on the particular work requested.
                Special requests that don't match anything on the sheet are welcome, just shoot me your idea and I will give you a quote if I can do it.
            </li>
            <li>
                Half of the payment must be provided up-front, with the remaining amount paid upon completion.
                Expect work-in-progress images to be somewhat low resolution and/or watermarked.
                I will only send the final full resolution image after receiving the final payment (USD only, paypal preferred).
            </li>
            <li>
                I may deny any commission request for any reason.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you cancel your order after I have started working, I will not refund your advance payment.
            </li>
            <li>
                I may cancel and refund an order at any point.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Rights and Licensing</h3>
        <ul class="plist">
            <li>
                I (the seller) retain all rights to the work.
                Expect me to post the finished work on my social media.
            </li>
            <li>
                You (the customer) get a license to use the work exclusively for the purpose it was commissioned for. Unauthorized commercial use is prohibited.
            </li>
