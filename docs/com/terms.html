            <h3>Orders, Payments, and Refunds</h3>
            <ul class="plist">
                <li>
                    The prices listed on the commission sheet are estimates and I may adjust them depending on the particular work requested.
                    Special requests that don't match anything on the sheet are welcome, just shoot me your idea and I will give you a quote if I can do it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Half of the payment must be provided up-front, with the remaining amount paid upon completion.
                    Expect work-in-progress images to be somewhat low resolution and/or watermarked.
                    I will only send the final full resolution image after receiving the final payment (USD only, paypal preferred).
                </li>
                <li>
                    I may deny any commission request for any reason.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you cancel your order after I have started working, I will not refund your advance payment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I may cancel and refund an order at any point.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Rights and Licensing</h3>
            <ul class="plist">
                <li>
                    I (the seller) retain all rights to the work.
                    Expect me to post the finished work on my social media.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You (the customer) get a license to use the work exclusively for the purpose it was commissioned for. Unauthorized commercial use is prohibited.
