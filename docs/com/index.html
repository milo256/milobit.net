        Don't worry, they're pretty short and easy to understand.

        Here is a table of what you can expect to pay.
        The base price includes a rendered subject (like a character or vehicle) on
        a blank/solid background, with "minor" revisions allowed.
        That means you may change anything you'd like during the sketch phase,
        but later changes are limited to small details or colors.
        I might quote a price that's not on this chart if it is a
        particularly easy or difficult request.
        </p>
        <table class="prices" style="width:100%;">
            <tr><th>base price</th><td>$120 USD</td></tr>
            <tr><th>add background</th><td>$40 USD</td></tr>
            <tr><th>add additional subject/view</th><td>$60 USD</td></tr>
        </table>
        <p>
        line drawings (not colored) are half price.
        </p>
